            >HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring content on the web. It uses elements and tags to define headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and other resources, and works together with CSS and JavaScript to build accessible, interactive web pages.</p>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to control the presentation of HTML content—defining colors, fonts, spacing, and layout (including Flexbox and Grid) and enabling responsive designs with media queries so sites look good across devices while keeping style separate from structure.</p>
